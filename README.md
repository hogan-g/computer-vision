# CA326 Project Repo: Class Vision

> Joshua Ward & Gareth Hogan

## Our System

Our system is a webapp called Class Vision, the system allows users to analyse lectures or classes and receive reports on stats such at attention, emotion and how many students were present. The system uses computer vision technology to be able to analyze images captured during the course of a lecture.
