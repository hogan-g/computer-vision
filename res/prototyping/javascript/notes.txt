Successful - Can grab media device and display on browser a stream of webcam

Next:
- How do I send that stream back to python
- currently docker is fed a device via a flag in docker run 
- instead of opencv opening a camera, we want it to receive the stream from the js/browser
- how do so?
    AJAX
    Sockets
    Something else?
